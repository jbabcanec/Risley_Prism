# * Because in a realstic scenario you dont want the wedge intersecting with the work piece, 
# this value should technically be greater than (D/2)*cos(phi_last). Therefore any succesive 
# value in the list that's greater than D/2 will be definitively be fine. Otherwise, check.

# Note, just because something is possible doesn't mean you should do itâ„¢
