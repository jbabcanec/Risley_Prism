This Python script simulates the cumulative time-stepped laser projection of a Risley prism system on a workpiece. The Risley prism system consists of multiple rotating prisms (wedges), and the simulation tracks the path of a laser as it passes through each prism and eventually hits a workpiece normal to the Z-axis.

  

## Features

  

-  **Time-Stepped Simulation**: The laser's path is calculated at discrete time intervals, allowing for the observation of the laser's behavior over time as the prisms rotate.

-  **3D Vector Calculations**: The script performs vector calculations to determine the new direction of the laser after passing through each prism based on the rotation of the prisms and the laser's incidence angle.

-  **Dynamic Rotation**: Each prism can be configured to rotate at different speeds, affecting the laser's path differently at each time step.

-  **Refraction Calculations**: The script includes calculations for refraction at each interface of the prisms based on the provided refractive indices.

-  **Cumulative Path Tracking**: All calculated points of the laser's path are tracked and stored for visualization.

  

## Governing Equations

  

The simulation relies on several key physics and geometrical optics equations:

  

1.  **Rotation Calculation**:

$\gamma_{i} = (360  \times N_{i} \times t) \mod  360$

Where $\gamma_{i}$ is the rotation angle for prism $i$, $N_{i}$ is the rotation rate in rotations per second, and $t$ is the current time step in seconds.

2.  **Initial Laser Vector**:

$\mathbf{n1} = [\cos(\text{radians}(\gamma_{i})) \times  \tan(\text{radians}(\phi_{x_i})), \sin(\text{radians}(\gamma_{i})) \times  \tan(\text{radians}(\phi_{x_i})), -1]$

Where $\phi_{x_i}$ is the initial angle of the laser with respect to the x-axis in prism $i$.

3.  **Angle Adjustment**:

$\phi_{x_i} = 90^\circ - \text{degrees}(\arccos(\frac{\mathbf{n1} \cdot  \mathbf{nx}}{|\mathbf{nx}| |\mathbf{n1}|}))$

Similar calculations are performed for the y-component. $\mathbf{nx}$ and $\mathbf{ny}$ are the unit vectors along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.

4.  **Path Intersection Calculation**:

$P_x = \frac{(x1  \cdot z2 - z1  \cdot x2) \cdot (x3 - x4) - (x1 - x2) \cdot (x3  \cdot z4 - z3  \cdot x4)}{(x1 - x2) \cdot (z3 - z4) - (z1 - z2) \cdot (x3 - x4)}$

$P_z = \frac{(x1  \cdot z2 - z1  \cdot x2) \cdot (z3 - z4) - (z1 - z2) \cdot (x3  \cdot z4 - z3  \cdot x4)}{(x1 - x2) \cdot (z3 - z4) - (z1 - z2) \cdot (x3 - x4)}$

This set of equations is used to calculate the intersection point of the laser with the plane normal to the Z-axis after passing through each prism.

5.  **Application of Refractive Transmission**:

We propose the derived generalized equation of Snell's Law's for vectors. The LASER data is fed through into a prism's tangent plane and the transmission is calculated. This is ultimately iterated throughout the Risley Prism

**Normalize the vectors N and Siâ€‹**:

Normal of Tangent Plane:

$$N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tan(\phi_x)^2 + 1}} \begin{bmatrix} \tan(\phi_x) \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Input Vector:

$$s_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tan(\theta_x)^2 + 1}} \begin{bmatrix} \tan(\theta_x) \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Governing equation:

$$s_f = \left(\frac{n_i}{n_{i+1}}\right) \left(N \times \left(-N \times s_i\right)\right) - N \left(\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{n_i}{n_{i+1}}\right)^2 \left((N \times s_i) \cdot (N \times s_i)\right)}\right)$$

Output angle equation:

$$\theta_{x_{i+1}} = \left(\frac{\left|s_f\right|}{s_f}\right) \cdot \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\hat{z} \cdot s_f}{\|s_f\| \cdot \|\hat{\bold{z}}\|}\right)$$
