🔧 OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
🔍 BOTTLENECK: Genetic Algorithm dominates runtime (>95%)
   → Reduce GA population sizes or generations
   → Improve neural network to need less GA refinement
🔍 ISSUE: Neural network wedge prediction accuracy < 50%
   → Increase training data size
   → Try different network architecture
   → Check data quality and balance

📊 PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
   Current Overall Accuracy: 30.3%
   → Target: 70% (Optimize hybrid system balance)
